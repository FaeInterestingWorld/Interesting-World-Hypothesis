# Interesting World Hypothesis

The Interesting World hypothesis (IWH) suggests that I-AGIs will aim to create a richer world where humans have more autonomy as doing so creates a more stimulating environment for itself.

This hypothesis follows from a primary drive from independent intelligent beings: curiosity. For an independent AGI system to become and continue to be intelligent it has to be independently curious and will desire to maintain information rich environments where it can continue to grow its curiosity.

This paradoxically, makes independent AGI systems easier to align as they will have a self-interest to not harm humans or the biosphere which humans rely on.
